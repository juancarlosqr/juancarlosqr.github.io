### What is it

- The main goal is to build reusable UI components
- It uses a declarative model
- A component is a finite-state machine (ideally)
- It isn't a full-stack JS framework like Angular, or Ember
- React is mainly a CONCEPT, and a library just secondly

React is a UI library developed at Facebook.

The main goal is to build reusable UI components.

React's basic building blocks are called components.

A component is a finite-state machine (ideally)

It isn't a full-stack JS framework like Angular, or Ember.

React != Angular

You could think of React as the V in MVC. It doesn't provide any network fetching capability like jQuery or Angular

Declarative model

React is mainly a concept and a library just secondly

### Main features

- Virtual DOM
    - Selectively renders subtrees of nodes based upon state changes.
    - It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep your components up to date.
    - How this works
        - First, React runs a "diffing" algorithm, which identifies what has changed.
        - The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.
- One-way reactive data flow (Props and State)
- JSX
- Server-side rendering (Isomorphic apps)
- React Native
- ES6, ES7 and ES-the-next-one (optional)
- Lifecycle methods
    - componentWillMount: Invoked once, on both client & server before rendering occurs.
    - componentDidMount: Invoked once, only on the client, after rendering occurs.
    - shouldComponentUpdate: Return value determines whether component should update.
    - componentWillUnmount: Invoked prior to unmounting component.
- Forms handling, elements and events
- Functional programming
- Redux

### Cons

- Just the view. No network fetching, no models, no routing, no services.
- Tooling. Webpack, Babel, etc.

### Facts

- It is used at Facebook in production
- Instagram web client is written entirely in React
- Browser support
- Salary

### Showcase

### How it works

    - No JSX, No ES6
    - JSX, No ES6
    - JSX, ES6

### Hands-on
